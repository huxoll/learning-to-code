# learning-to-code

A set of my recommended resources for learning to code, starting from zero.

## Part 1: Programming Foundations

Understanding the basic ideas of algorithms and object oriented design are
prerequisites for development.

- [Programming Foundations: Algorithms](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-algorithms)  
1 hour, 45 minutes

- [Programming Foundations: Object-Oriented Design](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-object-oriented-design-3)  
2 hours, 40 minutes

These courses might be optional. If you already have a background in Computer
Science or have picked up the terminology and concepts, feel free to skip ahead.

## Part 2: The Python Language

Learning a programming language and working through some development is key to
understanding dev challenges.

- [Learning Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-python-2)  
  2 hours, 11 minutes

- [Python Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2)  
4 hours, 45 minutes

- [Learning the Python 3 Standard Library](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-the-python-3-standard-library)  
2 hours, 9 minutes

- [Code Clinic: Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/code-clinic-python-2)  
1 hour, 15 minutes

- [OPTIONAL: Python: Design Patterns](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-design-patterns)  
1 hour, 59 minutes

- [OPTIONAL: Python: Advanced Design Patterns](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-advanced-design-patterns)  
1 hour, 24 minutes

## Part 3: Development Ecosystem

Modern software development takes place in a larger environment, where testing, deployment and support are part of a developerâ€™s process.

These might be optional if you're just writing scripts for a single user on a single machine, but if you want to work on a large project with others, this is indispensable.

- [Cloud Native Twelve-Factor Applications](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cloud-native-twelve-factor-applications)  
45 minutes

- [Learning Ansible](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-ansible)  
59 minutes

- [Ansible Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ansible-essential-training)  
3 hours, 17 minutes

- [DevOps Foundations: Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/devops-foundations-continuous-delivery-continuous-integration/ci-in-action-with-jenkins)  
2 hours, 9 minutes

## Other Approaches

The prior links work well if you learn in a classroom style, with a combination of watching and doing. For a very hands-on approach, I also like the "koans" style.

[Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans)

In this approach, you use the test driven develoment (TDD) approach, where you start with a body of Python code that is a bunch of tests, all of which are initially broken.  You proceed through the codebase writing the code to allow the tests to pass, learning Python coding techniques and language as you go.
